**My Gym Exercise Workout Weight Lifting Routine**

## Create

Routine should be a 3-day schedule, but if time does not permit, switch to a 2-day routine.

**There should be a 1-day rest period** between routine days.

Each exercise should be five sets of 10 reps.

For free weights, start with no weights, and add weight for each set.

Never add so much weight that your form is thrown off.

## Notes

### Squats

Don’t go past thighs parallel to floor. Keep knees over feet, and push thighs outward. Feet at 15º angles.

### Neck Lift

Lie flat, slightly lift neck and roll head and chin towards chest; hold for as long as possible.

### Deadlifts

Keep back straight and stick butt out and up in air. Keep bar over middle of feet and lift bar along body, pulling into crotch at end with some back curvature.

When warming up with no weigths, don’t go all the way down (pretend like there’s weights on the bar).

### Guidelines for stretching

- Continue to breathe slowly and rhythmically
- Stretch only to the point of mild tension
- Move slowly when stretching and never bounce
- Stretch daily to maintain good flexibility and range of motion
- A “warm” muscle will stretch better than a “cold” muscle
- Hold the stretch on big muscles (leg muscles) for at least 15 seconds
- If anything hurts, **don’t do it!**
