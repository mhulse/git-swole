Routine should be a 3-day schedule, but if time does not permit, switch to a 2-day routine.

**There should be a 1-day rest period** between routine days.

Each exercise should be five sets of 10 reps.

For free weights, start with no weights, and add weight for each set.

Never add so much weight that your form is thrown off.

### Guidelines for stretching

- Continue to breathe slowly and rhythmically
- Stretch only to the point of mild tension
- Move slowly when stretching and never bounce
- Stretch daily to maintain good flexibility and range of motion
- A “warm” muscle will stretch better than a “cold” muscle
- Hold the stretch on big muscles (leg muscles) for at least 15 seconds
- If anything hurts, **don’t do it!**
